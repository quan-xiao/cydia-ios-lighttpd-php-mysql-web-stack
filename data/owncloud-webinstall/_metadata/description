 Web installer for the newest available ownCloud version.
 ownCloud is a flexible, open source file sync and share solution. Whether using a mobile device, 
 a workstation, or a web client, ownCloud provides the ability to put the right files at your employees. 
 Fingertips on any device in one simple-to-use, secure, private and controlled solution.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use ownCloud: 
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
 - 'touch-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
   (For safety reasons, you should not use the touch- package)
 
 After the download please restart your lighttpd-Server and open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/setup-owncloud.php'.
 
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome create some problems.)
 The webinstaller will create files at /var/www/owncloud with permissions for the user 'daemon:_www'.
 
 During the installation you can choose MySQL or SQLite3.
 
 Using of SQLite3:
 - Quick, save and easy. Need not mutch memory.
 
 Using of MySQL:
 - You will get some errors one or two times. But that is not a problem. Reload the page and everything is fine.
 - You will needs an existing MySQL user and an existing MySQL database.
 - Before you start the ownCloud Setup, please create these with 'Adminer' or with the cydia package 'phpmyadmin-atv'.
  
 After the web installation you will find your ownCloud at 'http://your_ios_device/owncloud'
 
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/owncloud will be deleted.
 If you use MySQL, the database will not be removed.
